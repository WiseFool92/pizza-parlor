      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am from <span class="highlight">New England</span>. When I was 19 I moved to Oregon in the pursuit of 
      knowledge. Attending Oregon Tech and University of Oregon, I graduated 
      from UO with two degrees. continuing my pursuit of happiness, I strive
      everyday to help generate harmony and happiness. These values are of utmost

          <h2>Why Programming</h2>
          <p class="bg-info">
            To explain why I have chosen programming, we have to go back to the beginning.
            Growing up my uncle was heavily involved with technology. He exposed my cousin 
            and I at an early age and taught us to use computers. Fast forward to highschool, 
            I essentially lived in the networking room and began to cultivate my skills with
            database/network programming via Cisco modems. Fast forward to college, the only
            reason I didn't choose computer science as a major is that I felt self concious
            choosing the same major as 90% of my friends. Throughout my college years I have
            remained connected to tech and gravitated towards CS,ENG, and MED majors. I can 
            now say that I am happy that I have finally begun to pursue a career in tech,
            where I have always belonged. It just took me a few years to rediscover where my
            passions lie.
